# Collection of CI/CD stuff

TODO (Mostly just a collection of thoughts):
- [x] Spring boot REST API application to have something to test on.
- [ ] Docker container to run the API in. Swarm?
- [ ] Step by step readme to show CI/CD flow.
  - [ ] Have some error or performance issue in code.
  - [ ] First patch is quicker but still produces some errors. Caught in testing.
  - [ ] Second patch works. Automatic deployment?
- [ ] CI/CD tools
  - [ ] Jenkins
  - [ ] Nexus
  - [ ] ...
